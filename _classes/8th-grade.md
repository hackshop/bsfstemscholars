### About Hack Shop

Hack Shop is a student-interest driven, self-paced environment that focuses on the many forms that technology can take in our young people’s lives and empowers them to “hack” it to their liking. In this course, hacking isn’t a bad word or a criminal activity, it is the process of taking disparate pieces of information or a diverse set of tools and combining them in a new way to create new knowledge and solutions. Hacking might be a quick and dirty process, but it is a necessary step in exploration and learning.

This is some of what we’re doing:

*   [Webmaker](http://webmaker.org)
*   [MIT Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/)
*   [Makey-Makey](http://www.makeymakey.com/)
*   [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/)
*   [Arduino](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/learn-arduino)
*   [Hacking Chromebooks](http://chromnignorant.blogspot.com/)

Our classroom is hosted on a private [Minigroup](https://minigroup.com/groups/12502), our workshops are connected on the [Chicago City of Learning](http://chicagocityoflearning.org), and our badges are powered by [Youtopia](http://youtopia.com).
