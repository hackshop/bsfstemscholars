Good Morning N00Bs (future H@KRs)! Welcome back to Hack Shop.

## Last time on Hack Shop

We introduced ourselves to each other in a couple of ways: through our personal hacking passions, our future ambitions, but we didn’t get to talk about something very important: **what makes us feel respected.** Today we’ll get to that.

We also spent a lot of time talking about what the word “hacking” can really mean and how we all do some form of it in our daily lives. To help codify what we mean by being good hackers, or White Hats, we reviewed the #CodeOfEthics, and **you all signed a pledge** to use your hacking powers for good! You are all White Hats now…

## Did you do your homework?

## Start Having Some Real Fun
