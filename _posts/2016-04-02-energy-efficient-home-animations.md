Along with there blueprints, the 7th grade students have used sketchup to make their animated models. Doing so has lead them one step closer to creating their 3D models. As this being a part of their end of the year experiment, this is going to need more work and effort. Most of the students have been working hard on the exterior of their homes, but soon they will all be working on their interior if the arenâ€™t already.

Below is how far some of the groups have gotten.
